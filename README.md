This is an index database search tool for the University of Tennessee Knoxville Libraries.  It combines several old database search tools into a single frontend for improved simplicity and discoverability for users. 

Development for this is on-going and is only a frontend that interacts with our Solr server.  We are in process of creating a more interactive backend for maintenance of records.
