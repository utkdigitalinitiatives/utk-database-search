                For a complete search, consult both the book and the online index. Also, biographies of composers frequently include descriptions of compositions; check for them in ML 410 or ML385-400. To find specific biographies in the catalog, use a Subject Keyword or Subject Browse search for the name of the composer. Another useful source is number 25 of the MLA Index and Bibliography Series, Analyses of Nineteenth and Twentieth-Century Music: 1940-1985, Reference ML113.M18 v.25, which indexes periodicals, dissertations and books.

                It is important to note that items contained in Harold Diamondâ€™s book and the MLA Index, may or may not be available from the UT Music Library.
